# Architecture decision records

Terse index of the load-bearing decisions and *why* they hold, so future work stays consistent. Each
points to the `context/` file with the full reasoning. Append new ADRs; change `Status:` to `Superseded`
rather than deleting. Dates are given where grounded; toolchain choices predate the 1.0 baseline.

## 001. DI is Koin, not Hilt

Status: Accepted

Hilt's Gradle plugin is broken on AGP 9.x in this window (dagger#5083 / #5099). Koin is pure-Kotlin
runtime DI with no Gradle plugin / annotation processor, so AGP can't break it. Detail:
`context/toolchain.md`.

## 002. Built-in Kotlin is overridden to 2.4.0 (not AGP's bundled 2.2.10)

Status: Accepted

The Kotlin-2.2 compiler can't read class metadata produced by Kotlin 2.4. KGP 2.4.0 goes on the root
buildscript classpath. Bumping AGP does not move Kotlin — the override is the lever. Detail:
`context/toolchain.md`.

## 003. Two radios behind one `MeshTransport` seam, no GMS/Nearby

Status: Accepted

Wi-Fi Aware (NAN) + Bluetooth LE run simultaneously behind `CompositeMeshTransport` (Bluetooth
preferred). Direct `android.*` radio APIs, no Google Nearby / GMS, so a device with only one radio still
meshes. Import boundary is enforced as a rule (`rules/mesh.md`); detail: `context/mesh-transport.md`.

## 004. Two-plane NAN design (cue plane + ephemeral NDP) with an accept-any responder

Status: Accepted · Re-audited 2026-07-04 (`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md`)

`maxNdiInterfaces == 1` is per-*role*: a single accept-any responder multiplexes many inbound NDPs, but
each initiator needs its own NDI. So coordination rides Wi-Fi Aware messages (no data path) and data rides
one ephemeral NDP brought up only for a digest-differing peer. Per-peer responders don't compose. Detail:
`context/mesh-transport.md`. A concurrent-serve redesign is proposed in
`docs/NAN_CONCURRENCY_REAUDIT.md` §5.

## 005. Layered opaque-CBOR wire + one frame signature

Status: Accepted

Three layers (`WireEnvelope` / `RelayEnvelope` / per-type content) of opaque `@ByteString` CBOR so a relay
rewrites only ttl/hops and passes `signed`+`sig` byte-for-byte — one Ed25519 signature authenticates every
type. Evolves additively. Detail: `context/wire-format.md`; break rules: `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 006. Convergent custody quota (frame-global `sentAt`, live-only, `ORIGIN_SELF` included)

Status: Accepted (DB v18, `forward_store.sentAt`)

The cue plane brings up a scarce NDP only when two peers' content digests differ, so the custody bound
must be identical on every node or the mesh churns forever. Evict newest-N by frame-global `(sentAt, id)`
on every origin, fold live ids only. Makes TTL constants convergence-critical. Detail:
`context/store-and-forward.md`.

## 007. Static analysis via standalone CLI; Kover is the one plugin exception

Status: Accepted

detekt/ktlint run as standalone CLIs in isolated root-build configs so they can't perturb `:app`'s
Kotlin-2.4 classpath. Coverage must instrument bytecode, so Kover is the deliberate plugin exception
(low-risk, no codegen; keep ≥ 0.9.8). Detail: `context/toolchain.md`.

## 008. DB v1 is the frozen launch baseline — migrations mandatory from v1

Status: Accepted

No destructive fallback: every `@Database` bump adds a tested `Migration` + a migration-test case; a
missing migration throws at open time (caught in CI). Pre-1.0 destructive v2…v22 history is collapsed.
Detail: `context/testing.md`; break record: `docs/WIRE_COMPAT.md`.

## 009. One shared "message request vs accepted" predicate (`Conversations.isAccepted`)

Status: Accepted

The Message Requests rule — a conversation is *accepted* (not a stranger's request) iff it is Nearby ∨
in the accepted set ∨ the DM peer is verified ∨ the user has authored in it — is the single source of
truth for the local notify gate (`InboundPipeline`), the retention sweep (`MeshManager.sweepLocalStorage`),
and the Message Requests UI (`ui/requests/`, chat-list partition). It lives as a **pure, Android-free**
function in `data/message/Conversations.kt` taking the three signals as sets, so a per-conversation check
and a whole-list partition share one rule that can't drift. It is a **local presentation decision only** —
never folded into custody/relay, so it is *not* convergence-critical (unlike the custody quota in ADR 006).
