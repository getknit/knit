# On-device content-moderation assets

Everything here is loaded locally at runtime — the app has **no `INTERNET` permission**, so models must
be **bundled**, never downloaded.

## `profanity_en.txt` (present)

Word list for the deterministic first pass of text moderation (`LexicalTextFilter`). A small starter
set — replace/extend with a vetted, permissively-licensed corpus (e.g. LDNOOBW) before release.

## `nsfw.tflite` (bundled — activates image moderation)

The NSFW image classifier consumed by `NsfwImageModerator`. Currently the **GantMan `nsfw_model`
MobileNetV2 (140/224)**: input `[1,224,224,3]` float32 normalized `÷255`, softmax output `[1,5]` =
`drawings, hentai, neutral, porn, sexy`; the moderator flags on `hentai+porn+sexy ≥ 0.7`. ~17 MB float
model, **managed via Git LFS** (`.gitattributes` tracks `*.tflite`).

Shapes and input dtype are read from the model at load, so swapping in a compatible model "just works":
a MobileNet-style classifier with `[1,H,W,3]` input (float32 `[0,1]` or uint8 `0..255`) and `[1,N]`
output. A quantized `.tflite` (~4–5 MB) drops in unchanged. To use a model with a different class
layout, adjust `unsafeClasses`/`threshold` in `NsfwImageModerator`. If the file is **absent or fails to
load, the moderator degrades to allow-all** (hooks + blur UI stay wired).

**Vet the model's license** for redistribution in the APK before release, and tune the threshold
on-device. `*.tflite` is kept uncompressed in the APK (`androidResources { noCompress }` in
`app/build.gradle.kts`) so TFLite can mmap it.

## `toxicity.tflite` + `tokenizer.json` + `labels.txt` (bundled — activates text ML moderation)

The on-device toxicity classifier consumed by `MlTextModerator`, layered into `HybridTextModerator`
after the lexical pass (it only sees text the word list clears). **Detoxify "unbiased-small" (ALBERT)**
fine-tuned on the Jigsaw Unintended Bias dataset, exported to TFLite: inputs `input_ids` /
`attention_mask` `[1, 128]` (int), output `[1, 16]` sigmoid probabilities over the labels in
`labels.txt` — 7 toxicity labels (`toxicity, severe_toxicity, obscene, identity_attack, insult, threat,
sexual_explicit`) plus 9 identity-mention columns. ~14.6 MB dynamic-int8 model, **managed via Git LFS**
(`.gitattributes` tracks `*.tflite`).

**Selective blocking:** `MlTextModerator` enforces only a configured subset of categories — by default
`severe_toxicity`, `identity_attack`, `sexual_explicit`, `threat` (serious abuse) — and deliberately
ignores general `toxicity`/`insult`/`obscene` (rudeness) and the identity-mention columns. Tune
thresholds on-device.

`tokenizer.json` drives the pure-Kotlin `SentencePieceTokenizer` (no native library → 16 KB-page safe;
verified id-for-id against the HuggingFace tokenizer). If any asset is **absent or fails to load,
`MlTextModerator` degrades to allow-all** and the lexical pass still runs.
